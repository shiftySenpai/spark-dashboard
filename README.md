# Spark Dashboard

Real-time hardware and LLM inference monitoring for Linux systems with NVIDIA
GPUs. Developed and tested on the NVIDIA DGX Spark, but works on any Linux
host with NVIDIA drivers — discrete-GPU workstations, DGX boxes, cloud VMs.
A Rust backend collects GPU, CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics alongside
vLLM engine statistics and streams them over WebSocket to a React frontend.

## Quick Start

### Install on your Linux host

Run as your normal user on any Linux host with NVIDIA drivers (requires Rust 1.95+):

```bash
cargo install spark-dashboard
sudo ~/.cargo/bin/spark-dashboard service install
systemctl status spark-dashboard
```

The dashboard is now served on port 3000. See [Install on your Linux host](#install-on-your-linux-host-1)
for the full guide, config overrides, and uninstall.

### Run with Docker

Prefer containers? Run the published multi-arch image (needs the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)):

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --pid=host -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  -v spark-dashboard-state:/var/lib/spark-dashboard \
  --group-add "$(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3)" \
  ghcr.io/niklasfrick/spark-dashboard:latest
```

`--group-add` puts the container in the host's `docker` group so it can read the
mounted socket and discover vLLM **containers**. Skip it (or get the GID wrong)
and engine discovery silently falls back to host processes only — containerized
engines won't appear. The named volume keeps saved dashboards across container
replacement; without it they die with the container.

Or with Compose (host networking + GPU + socket mount preconfigured):

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niklasfrick/spark-dashboard/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niklasfrick/spark-dashboard/main/deploy/docker/.env.docker.example -o .env
# set DOCKER_GID to your host's docker group: getent group docker | cut -d: -f3
docker compose up -d
```

See [`deploy/docker/docker.md`](./deploy/docker/docker.md) for networking modes, GPU
passthrough, env vars, and troubleshooting.

### Develop locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niklasfrick/spark-dashboard.git
cd spark-dashboard
cp dev/.env.example .env           # edit with your remote host's user/host
./dev/dev.sh
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. See [`dev/README.md`](./dev/README.md)
for details on what each script does.

## Features

**Hardware Monitoring** (1s polling via NVML, sysinfo, procfs)
- GPU utilization, temperature, power draw, clock frequencies, fan speed
- GPU event detection — thermal throttling, hardware slowdown, power brake
- CPU aggregate and per-core utilization with heatmap
- Memory breakdown — CPU RAM and GPU VRAM separately on discrete-GPU hosts,
  or a single unified pool on systems where CPU and GPU share memory
  (e.g. DGX Spark GB10, GH200)
- Disk and network I/O throughput

**LLM Engine Monitoring** (vLLM via Prometheus metrics)
- Tokens per second (generation + prompt)
- Time to first token, inter-token latency, end-to-end latency, queue time
- Active/queued requests, batch size
- KV cache utilization, prefix cache hit rate
- Automatic engine discovery via process scan and Docker API
- SLO Goodput

**Multi-Engine Support**
- Run and monitor any number of inference engines side by side — each
  vLLM process or container is detected automatically
- Every engine panel follows the page's engine selection by default, so one
  layout works whether the host runs one engine or four
- Pin a panel to a specific engine to watch two of them at once; a pinned
  panel whose engine is gone says so and keeps its place rather than
  silently showing a different one
- With several engines on a host, each panel names the one it is showing and
  marks the provider of the model it is serving

**Splunk HEC Export** (opt-in)
- Pushes each active snapshot to a HEC endpoint in the multiple-measurement
  metrics format; GPU events are buffered and flushed on recovery
- Header status indicator with honest failure reasons, plus a test-connection
  probe against the in-progress (unsaved) edit

**Dashboard**
- A grid of panels you arrange yourself: drag, resize, add from a palette of
  every metric, remove what you do not want, save or discard
- Multiple named pages with their own URLs, so a wall display can be pointed
  at one arrangement and stay there across reboots
- Fits the viewport on desktop with no scrolling; stacks into one column on
  a phone, derived from your desktop arrangement
- Per-panel time window, arc gauges, time-series charts, per-core heatmap
- 15-minute rolling history with circular buffers
- Layout saved on the server, shared by everyone who opens the instance
- Connection status badge, staleness detection, auto-reconnect

```

Two independent Tokio tasks run in parallel — one for hardware metrics (NVML,
sysinfo, procfs) and one for engine detection/polling. Both feed into a
broadcast channel that fans out to all connected WebSocket clients. In
production the frontend is embedded in the binary via `rust-embed`; in
development, Vite serves the frontend locally and proxies API/WebSocket
traffic to the remote backend.

## Configuration

All operator config lives in a repo-root `.env` file. Copy the template and
edit:

```bash
cp dev/.env.example .env
```

| Variable           | Purpose                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DEPLOY_USER`      | SSH user on the remote host (required)                                               |
| `DEPLOY_HOST`      | Hostname or IP of the remote host (required)                                         |
| `DEPLOY_DIR`       | Project path on the remote host, relative to remote home (default `spark-dashboard`) |
| `VITE_BACKEND_URL` | Where Vite proxies `/ws` and `/api` (default `http://localhost:3000`)                |

Legacy `SPARK_USER` / `SPARK_HOST` / `SPARK_DIR` are still accepted as a
fallback when `DEPLOY_*` are unset — `dev.sh` prints a one-line deprecation
note. The scripts in `dev/` source this file; Vite picks up `VITE_*` variables
automatically. `.env` is gitignored — never commit it.

## Install on your Linux host

The dashboard runs as a supervised `systemd` service. Two install paths; both
build from source on the host.

### Option A — via cargo (recommended)

```bash
# On the host. Requires Rust 1.95+, NVIDIA drivers, and internet access.
cargo install spark-dashboard
sudo ~/.cargo/bin/spark-dashboard service install
systemctl status spark-dashboard
```

`cargo install` pulls the crate from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/spark-dashboard)
and compiles it locally. `service install` copies the binary to
`/usr/local/bin`, creates a locked-down `spark-dashboard` system user (added
to `video`, `render`, `docker` groups for NVML and Docker access), writes the
systemd unit, and enables it.

> **Why the explicit `~/.cargo/bin/` path?** `cargo install` drops the
> binary in `~/.cargo/bin`, which isn't on `sudo`'s sanitized `secure_path`
> and isn't always on the user's interactive PATH either (depends on how
> Rust was installed). Passing the absolute path makes the command work
> regardless. After `service install` copies the binary to `/usr/local/bin`,
> subsequent `sudo spark-dashboard …` calls (e.g. `service status`,
> `service uninstall`) resolve normally.

### Option B — from a local checkout

Use this when you want to install without crates.io (audit the source,
air-gapped install, or deploy an unreleased commit).

```bash
# On the host. Run as your normal user — the script escalates to sudo
# only for the systemd wiring step.
git clone https://github.com/niklasfrick/spark-dashboard.git
cd spark-dashboard
./deploy/host/install.sh
```

This builds the frontend (`npm run build`) and the Rust binary
(`cargo build --release`), then hands off to the same `service install`
logic as Option A. You'll be prompted for your sudo password once, when
the service is installed.

### Managing the service

```bash
sudo systemctl {start|stop|restart} spark-dashboard
journalctl -u spark-dashboard -f          # follow logs
sudo spark-dashboard service status       # same as `systemctl status`
```

Optional overrides live in `/etc/spark-dashboard/config.env` — set
`SPARK_DASHBOARD_PORT`, `SPARK_DASHBOARD_BIND`, `SPARK_DASHBOARD_POLL_INTERVAL`,
`SPARK_DASHBOARD_GPU_INDEX`, `SPARK_DASHBOARD_STATE_DIR`,
`SPARK_DASHBOARD_PROVIDER_API_KEY`, or `RUST_LOG`, then
`sudo systemctl restart spark-dashboard`.

### Upgrade

```bash
# Option A
cargo install --force spark-dashboard && sudo ~/.cargo/bin/spark-dashboard service install

# Option B
cd spark-dashboard && git pull && ./deploy/host/install.sh
```

Re-running `service install` is idempotent: it stops the service, swaps the
binary, and starts it again, preserving `/etc/spark-dashboard/config.env`.

### Uninstall

```bash
sudo spark-dashboard service uninstall         # keep /etc/spark-dashboard
sudo spark-dashboard service uninstall --purge # also remove /etc/spark-dashboard
```

Neither form touches `/var/lib/spark-dashboard`, so saved dashboards survive an
uninstall/reinstall cycle. Remove that directory by hand to start clean.

### CLI options

```
spark-dashboard [OPTIONS]                 run the server (default)
spark-dashboard service install [--prefix /usr/local]
spark-dashboard service uninstall [--purge]
spark-dashboard service status

  -p, --port <PORT>           Listen port [default: 3000] [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_PORT]
  -b, --bind <BIND>           Bind address [default: 0.0.0.0] [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_BIND]
      --poll-interval <MS>    Polling interval ms [default: 1000] [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_POLL_INTERVAL]
      --state-dir <DIR>       Directory for saved state [default: /var/lib/spark-dashboard] [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_STATE_DIR]
      --gpu-index <IDX>       Optional NVML GPU index to monitor [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_GPU_INDEX]
      --simulate-gpus <N>     Append N fictive GPUs with simulated data (dev aid) [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_SIMULATE_GPUS]
      --engine <TYPE>         Manual engine type (e.g. vllm) [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_ENGINE]
      --engine-url <URL>      Manual engine endpoint (requires --engine) [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_ENGINE_URL]
      --engine-api-key <KEY>  API key for an endpoint, paired by index with --engine-url [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_ENGINE_API_KEY]
      --provider-api-key <KEY> Fallback API key for any endpoint [env: SPARK_DASHBOARD_PROVIDER_API_KEY]
```

On multi-GPU hosts, Spark Dashboard monitors all available NVIDIA GPUs by
default. Use `--gpu-index` to focus on one device. Engines are auto-detected via
process scan and Docker API. Use `--engine` and `--engine-url` to override when
auto-detection doesn't work. For a host-systemd installation, put the same
values in `/etc/spark-dashboard/config.env` as `SPARK_DASHBOARD_ENGINE` and
`SPARK_DASHBOARD_ENGINE_URL`; comma-separated engine and URL values are paired
by position.

For auth-gated deployments (e.g. vLLM started with `--api-key`), pass
`--engine-api-key` (index-paired with `--engine-url`) or set
`SPARK_DASHBOARD_PROVIDER_API_KEY` as a global fallback covering auto-detected
engines too. Model info is resolved from `/v1/models` once and cached —
re-resolved only on engine restart or every 10 minutes — so an auth-gated
engine is no longer hit on every poll tick.

### Dashboard configuration API

The dashboard configuration is a single document shared by everyone who opens
the instance, stored at `<state-dir>/dashboards.json`. The server keeps it as
opaque bytes — it never parses or validates the contents, and enforces only a
1 MiB size cap. Writes are atomic, and last write wins.

Both deployments arrange for `<state-dir>` to be `/var/lib/spark-dashboard`, the
binary's default:

| Deployment | Where it lives                    | Provided by                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| systemd    | `/var/lib/spark-dashboard`        | the unit's `StateDirectory=` grant, created and chowned to the service user on start |
| Docker     | the `spark-dashboard-state` volume | the Compose named volume; survives everything short of `down -v` |

The document therefore outlives restarts, upgrades and container replacement.
Override the location with `--state-dir` / `SPARK_DASHBOARD_STATE_DIR` — under
systemd that also needs a unit override, since `ProtectSystem=strict` leaves the
granted state directory the only writable path.

**Backing it up is copying the file.** There is deliberately no import/export
feature; the location is documented instead, so an operator can copy a
configuration to another host or keep a snapshot before experimenting:

```bash
# systemd
sudo cp /var/lib/spark-dashboard/dashboards.json ~/dashboards.backup.json
sudo systemctl stop spark-dashboard                                   # restore
sudo install -o spark-dashboard -g spark-dashboard -m 644 \
  ~/dashboards.backup.json /var/lib/spark-dashboard/dashboards.json
sudo systemctl start spark-dashboard

# Docker — see deploy/docker/docker.md for the volume commands
```

Stop the service first so the copy cannot land under a write, and **reload any
open dashboard afterwards**: a browser still holding the pre-restore document
would put it straight back on its next save.

> **The document's format is internal and subject to change.** It is the
> frontend's own versioned state, not a stable contract
> ([ADR-0002](./docs/adr/0002-configuration-is-an-opaque-document.md)) — copy the
> file whole, don't generate or hand-edit it. A document written by a newer build
> is refused by an older one, which falls back to the default preset with a
> banner rather than failing.

```
GET    /api/dashboard   the document, or 204 when none is stored
PUT    /api/dashboard   replaces it wholesale (204 on success)
DELETE /api/dashboard   removes it, resetting to the default preset (204)
```

`204` on read means "nothing saved" rather than an error — a fresh install and
a reset look identical, and the dashboard renders its default preset for both.
A write over the cap is rejected with `413`, leaving the stored document
untouched.

Every response carries `x-spark-dashboard-read-only`. It is `true` when the
state directory was not writable at startup, in which case reads still work,
writes are refused with `503`, and the dashboard shows a read-only banner
instead of pretending a save succeeded. A write that fails for some other
reason — a full disk, say — returns `500` and leaves the header `false`.

```bash
curl -i localhost:3000/api/dashboard                       # read
curl -X PUT localhost:3000/api/dashboard -d '{"pages":[]}' # save
curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/api/dashboard                # reset
```

Unmatched paths under `/api` return `404` rather than the app shell.

### Dashboard pages and kiosk URLs

A configuration holds any number of named **pages** — separate arrangements of
panels, kept side by side rather than one being chosen permanently. They are
created, renamed and deleted from the **Pages** menu in the header, and switched
between from the tabs beside it; tabs that do not fit the header move into an
overflow menu rather than pushing it out of shape.

Each page has its own URL, built from a stable id plus a readable slug:

```
/pages/<id>            e.g. /pages/overview
/pages/<id>/<slug>     e.g. /pages/overview/wall-display
```

The id is fixed when the page is created and never changes again; the slug is
whatever the page is called now, and is omitted when it would only repeat the
id. The second example above is the page created as *Overview* and since
renamed to *Wall Display*.

**Only the id is matched** — the slug is decoration. Renaming a page rewrites
the slug and leaves the id alone, so a kiosk browser or a bookmark pointed at
the old URL still lands on the same page. Pointing a wall display at one page's
URL is what makes it come back to that page after a reboot with no interaction.

Resetting is two-tiered: deleting a single page from the Pages menu takes that
page only, while **Reset everything** asks for confirmation and then removes the
stored document outright — which is the same `DELETE /api/dashboard` above, and
leaves the dashboard rendering its default preset. The dashboard always keeps at
least one page, so the last one cannot be deleted; resetting is the way to start
over.

### Log viewer (`--enable-log-viewer`, Linux only, opt-in)

`--enable-log-viewer` (or the `SPARK_DASHBOARD_ENABLE_LOG_VIEWER=1` env var)
registers an extra `/ws/logs` WebSocket endpoint that streams the tracked
engine container's Docker logs directly to the dashboard, using the bollard
Docker API (no `docker` CLI or shell required — works in distroless images).

- **Off by default.** Nothing is exposed unless the flag is passed.
- **`/ws/logs` is unauthenticated.** The dashboard binds `0.0.0.0` by default
  and the WebSocket has no auth layer, so anyone who can reach the port can
  read the stream.
- **Engine logs can contain sensitive data.** Inference-engine logs commonly
  include prompts, request payloads, and API keys passed on the command line.
  Treat the endpoint as equivalent to `docker logs` access.
- **Recommendation: only enable on trusted networks.** Put the dashboard behind
  a reverse proxy with auth, bind to `127.0.0.1`/`--bind 127.0.0.1`, or
  restrict the port with a firewall. Do not enable on a public-facing host.

The stream follows the engine selected in the dashboard: the frontend passes
the engine's endpoint as `/ws/logs?engine=<endpoint>`, which is validated
against the tracked engine state — only containers the dashboard knows as
engines can be streamed. Per container, one background Docker log stream fans
out to all clients watching it (same pattern as metrics) and stops when the
last viewer disconnects. stdout and stderr are line-buffered so split frames
don't produce partial lines.

When [Splunk HEC export](#splunk-hec-export-opt-in) is configured, the same
container logs are also forwarded to the `export.hec` target's
`events_index` as JSON events (sourcetype `spark_dashboard_engine_log` with a
`container` field) — never to the metrics index. Unlike the viewer, the
forwarding keeps running with no viewers connected, so the index stays
continuous; lines are batched once per second into a bounded buffer (oldest
dropped).

### Splunk HEC export (opt-in)

The dashboard can push its metrics into a Splunk HTTP Event Collector. The
target — HEC URL, token, metrics index, event index — lives in the shared
dashboard document (the **Export settings** dialog), so there is nothing on
the host, in `.env`, or on the CLI.

- **Off by default.** The exporter only runs when the document carries a
  usable `export.hec` target; a fresh or empty document exports nothing.
- **Metrics-type index required.** Each snapshot is one JSON event in
  Splunk's multiple-measurement format — `event: "metric"` with the
  `metric_name:*` fields under `fields` — so point it at an index with
  `datatype = metric`. A standard index accepts the events and indexes
  nothing.
- **Drop while down.** Once the endpoint is unreachable, new snapshots are
  dropped immediately — no unbounded memory growth during an outage, and the
  gap in the index is the outage. GPU events are the exception: they are the
  page-worthy data, buffered (cap 1000, oldest dropped) and flushed on
  recovery.
- **Idle hosts export nothing.** The silent gap is the record of idleness;
  GPU events are never idle-gated.
- **Engine container logs** (when the log viewer is enabled) are also
  forwarded to the events index as JSON events — see
  [Log viewer](#log-viewer--enable-log-viewer-linux-only-opt-in).
- **The status indicator reports the truth.** The header's "HEC Connection"
  badge is green while reachable and ingesting, red when the endpoint is down
  *or* rejecting data (the tooltip carries the reason — bad token, an index
  the token cannot write, rate limit), and gray when not configured. A
  rejected probe is not a success: it does not clear the last error or stamp
  a last-ok time.
- **Test without saving.** "Test connection" fires a one-off test event at
  the dialog's current URL/token/index. A field left blank falls back to the
  stored value, and the masked token placeholder never leaves the browser —
  the server keeps the stored token instead.

```
curl -s localhost:3000/api/export-status              # exporter state
curl -s -X POST localhost:3000/api/export/test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'         # one-off connectivity event
```

The Splunk side — minting a HEC token, the metrics index, and the
reverse-proxy topology for reaching HEC from outside the LAN — is covered in
[docs/splunk-hec-setup.md](docs/splunk-hec-setup.md).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Local machine** (macOS or Linux): Node.js 20+, npm, rsync, ssh
- **Remote host**: Linux + NVIDIA drivers, Rust 1.95+, SSH access with key-based auth (no password prompts)
- Optional: `brew install fswatch` for instant file-change detection (the
  watcher falls back to 2s polling without it)

### Running the dev environment

```bash
./dev/dev.sh
```

The script handles everything:

1. **Syncs** the full project to the remote host via rsync
2. **Builds** the Rust backend on the remote host (`cargo build --release`)
3. **Starts** the backend on the remote host (port 3000)
4. **Starts** the Vite dev server locally (port 5173)
5. **Watches** `src/` and `Cargo.toml` for Rust changes — auto-syncs and rebuilds on the remote host

| What you edit                        | What happens                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend files (`frontend/src/`)     | Vite hot-reloads instantly in the browser                                |
| Backend files (`src/`, `Cargo.toml`) | Auto-detected → rsync to remote host → rebuild → restart (~compile time) |

Useful while `dev.sh` is running:

```bash
# Watch backend logs in another terminal
ssh "${DEPLOY_USER}@${DEPLOY_HOST}" tail -f /tmp/spark-dashboard.log

# Press Ctrl+C in the dev.sh terminal to stop everything (cleans up the remote process too)
```

### How the proxy works

By default, Vite proxies `/ws` and `/api` to `localhost:3000` — this works out
of the box with any SSH tunnel that maps the remote host's port 3000 to your
local machine.

```
Browser → localhost:5173/ws  → Vite proxy → localhost:3000/ws (forwarded to remote)
Browser → localhost:5173/api → Vite proxy → localhost:3000/api (forwarded to remote)
```

To connect directly over the network instead, set in `.env`:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://${DEPLOY_HOST}:3000
```

The frontend connects to the WebSocket using `window.location.host`, so the
proxy is transparent — no code changes between dev and production.

## Releases

Releases are cut from `main` via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) —
conventional commits drive the version bump, merging the release PR tags
`vX.Y.Z` and triggers `cargo publish` to crates.io. `main` always reflects
the latest stable version; see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

## Testing

```bash
# Frontend (jsdom)
cd frontend && npm test

# Frontend layout-dependent specs (headless chromium)
cd frontend && npx playwright install chromium && npm run test:browser

# Backend (on Linux)
cargo test
```

Backend tests include platform-aware stubs — GPU and memory tests validate
real NVML/procfs parsing on Linux, with compile-time stubs on other platforms.
