 * The product masthead: title and page navigation.
 *
 * The page tabs sit *between* the title and the badge rather than replacing
 * either: the header's existing identity is what tells an operator at a glance
 * which tool they are looking at, and the rework preserves it. `pages` is a slot
 * rather than a prop the header renders itself, so the masthead stays free of
 * the configuration — it draws the same on the frame that has no document yet.
 *
 * `trailing` holds the header indicators (the engine status strip, the
 * Splunk HEC status dot and the settings entry point), so they stay hard
 * right.
