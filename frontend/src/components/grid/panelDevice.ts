/**
 * How a panel's content tells its frame which hardware it ended up reading.
 *
 * The device belongs on the title row — "GPU Utilization · NVIDIA GB10", the
 * way the fixed dashboard's cards read — but only the content knows what it
 * resolved to, and only the frame owns that row. So the content reports it
 * upward rather than the frame reaching down: a frame that resolved bindings
 * itself would have to subscribe to every snapshot, which would re-render all
 * of the grid on every tick and undo the point of the per-panel store.
 *
 * Absent outside a frame — a panel rendered on its own in a spec reports to
 * nobody and renders exactly the same.
