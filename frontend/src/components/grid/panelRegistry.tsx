/**
 * Which React component renders each panel type's content.
 *
 * The registry is keyed by the persisted panel-type vocabulary in
 * `lib/dashboard/panels`, and is deliberately allowed to lag it: a type the
 * vocabulary knows but no component implements yet renders as a placeholder
 * that keeps its grid slot. That is what lets the panel tickets land one at a
 * time against a preset that already names every type.
 *
 * Nothing is lagging today — every type in the vocabulary has a component, and
 * `panelRegistry.test` holds it that way. The lag is kept as an affordance for
 * the next type to be named, not as a description of this build.
