 * narrow boxes, and the compact value-only rendering for short ones. Panels
 * supply the pieces; the mode decision lives in `mode.ts` where it is testable
 * without a layout engine.
 *
 * Every panel also names the hardware it is reading — which GPU model, which
 * disk, which interface. A dashboard that says "76%" without saying what is at
 * 76% is only useful to someone who already knows the machine. The name is
 * handed to the frame rather than drawn here, so it sits on the title row
 * beside the metric and costs the panel's own box no height.
