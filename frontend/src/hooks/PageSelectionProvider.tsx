 * they authored, and writing it would make every glance at a second GPU a
 * change to what everyone else sees. It resets per page because the provider
 * sits inside the page, which is keyed by page id.
 *
 * The **source** is the opposite — the page's persisted default, read from the
 * document and merely carried through here so the panel hooks resolve both
 * layers in one place.
