/**
 * What a panel points at, and what it resolves to on this particular host.
 *
 * A binding is either a concrete target — a GPU by integer index, an engine by
 * endpoint, the same identity keys the rest of the dashboard uses — or the
 * sentinel `follow`, which defers to the page-level selection. Follow is what
 * lets the shipped default preset be one static document that is right on a
 * one-GPU laptop and on a four-GPU server, instead of a layout generated at
 * runtime that would need testing across every permutation.
 *
 * **Silent substitution is prohibited.** Every way of not having a target
 * resolves to something the UI renders as a placeholder keeping its grid slot —
 * never to a different target. Quietly showing one engine's numbers under the
 * label the operator pinned is the worst available failure on a metrics tool,
 * because it cannot be noticed. That is also why a pin that cannot be read does
 * not quietly revert to following: the operator may well have retitled the panel
 * after the target it named.
