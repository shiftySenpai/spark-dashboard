 * could only answer with the host's default — the first running engine. The
 * source lets the operator author the answer into the document itself: a
 * "Qwen page" that opens on Qwen for every colleague and kiosk, or an overview
 * page whose engine panels show every engine's figures, one row each.
 *
 * **Absent means automatic.** A page with no source follows the host's default
 * exactly as every page did before the field existed, which is what lets the
 * schema migration be a no-op and the shipped preset stay a single static
 * document.
