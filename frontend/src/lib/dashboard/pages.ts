/**
 * The page list an operator keeps by hand: making a page, naming it, and
 * throwing one away.
 *
 * Pages are how one dashboard holds more than one arrangement — a training view
 * and an idle health view, kept side by side instead of one being chosen
 * permanently. Everything here is pure, and every function is a **replacement**:
 * a document in, a document out, with the pages that were not touched kept by
 * identity.
 *
 * Unlike a panel edit, a page edit is not part of an edit session. Creating,
 * renaming and deleting are each a deliberate, named request rather than a
 * side effect of dragging, so they are written when they are made — see
 * `GridPageContent`, which is where that decision is carried out.
 *
 * Two invariants live here rather than in the UI, because they are properties of
 * the document and every future caller needs them:
 *
 * - **A page id is never reused.** It is what a page's URL is built from, so two
 *   pages sharing one would be two pages at one address.
 * - **The last page cannot be deleted.** A document with no pages has nothing to
 *   render; starting over is what a reset is for, and it asks first.
