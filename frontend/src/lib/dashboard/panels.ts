/**
 * Every panel the dashboard can put on a page, and what each one binds to.

 * temperature and power the whole screen and drop the network and disk panels
 * entirely. It is the reason the configuration is a versioned schema with a
 * migration obligation — a closed panel set with opaque geometry was considered
 * and rejected.
 *
 * **The ids are persisted.** They appear verbatim in saved documents, so
 * renaming one is a breaking change that needs a migration, not a refactor.
