/**
 * The dashboard an operator gets before configuring anything.
 *
 * It is a **static document**, not a layout generated from the host it lands on.
 * Every panel binds with the `follow` sentinel, which resolves to the page-level
 * selection, so the same document is right on a one-GPU laptop and on a four-GPU
 * server — the alternative would be runtime generation that needs testing across
 * every GPU and engine permutation.
 *
 * "Nothing configured" and "reset" are the same state: the document does not
 * exist on the server, and this is what renders instead.
 *
 * **The arrangement is three bands, one question each**: what the machine is
 * serving, what the GPU is doing, and what else the host is up to. Within a band the leading
 * panel is double width, because a default that gives ten metrics the same area
 * says none of them matters more than the others — which is the flaw this rework
 * exists to fix. It is deliberately not a reproduction of the fixed dashboard it
 * replaced: that layout was eight equal hardware cards under an engine block,
 * and reproducing it would have carried its lack of hierarchy across.
 *
 * The engine band leads, because what the machine is serving is what an
 * operator opens the dashboard to see; the GPU band under it is the answer to
 * "why". The cost is accepted deliberately: on a host running no engines the
 * first band is three placeholders, and the hardware an operator can still use
 * starts one band down.
 *
 * **One page**, not several. A second preset page could only be another
 * arrangement of the same panels — the pages worth having are the ones an
 * operator builds for their own workload, and a page they did not ask for is a
 * tab they have to delete. The one page tiles the grid exactly, so the desktop
 * layout fills the viewport without scrolling.
 *
 * **No log panel**, on any page. The log viewer is off by default in every
 * deployment, so a preset that placed one would open a stock install on a panel
 * explaining that a feature is unavailable. Logs are placed by the operator who
 * turned them on.
